Several methods have been developed for reconstructing developmental trajec- tories from single-cell transcriptomic data, but efforts on analyzing single-cell epigenomic data and on trajectory visualization remain limited. Here we present STREAM, an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We have tested STREAM on several syn- thetic and real datasets generated with different single-cell technologies. We further demonstrate its utility for understanding myoblast differentiation and disentangling known heterogeneity in hematopoiesis for different organisms.

Reducing the complexity and producing compact and interpretable representations of such data remains a challenging task. Most of the existing computational methods are based on exploring the local data point neighbourhood relations, a step that can perform poorly in the case of multidimensional and noisy data. Here we present ElPiGraph, a scalable and robust method for approximation of datasets with complex structures which does not require computing the complete data distance matrix or the data point neighbourhood graph. This method is able to withstand high levels of noise and is capable of approximating complex topologies via principal graph ensembles that can be combined into a consensus principal graph. ElPiGraph deals efficiently with large and complex datasets in various fields from biology, where it can be used to infer gene dynamics from single-cell RNA-Seq, to astronomy, where it can be used to explore complex structures in the distribution of galaxies.","tags":["Principal Graph","Graph Grammar","Complex Topologies","Single Cell","Large Data"],"title":"Robust and Scalable Learning of Data Manifold with Complex Topologies via ElPiGraph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoping Han","Haide Chen","Daosheng Huang","Huidong Chen","Lijiang Fei","Chen Cheng","He Huang","Guo-Cheng Yuan and Guoji Guo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1522886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522886400,"objectID":"efb720387fef44cb7728061b0712844f","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/publication/han-x-genome-biology-2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/han-x-genome-biology-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide powerful models for studying cellular differentiations and unlimited sources of cells for regenerative medicine. However, a comprehensive single-cell level differentiation roadmap for hPSCs has not been achieved. We use high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), based on optimized microfluidic circuits, to profile early differentiation lineages in the human embryoid body system. We present a cellular-state landscape for hPSC early differentiation that covers multiple cellular lineages, including neural, muscle, endothelial, stromal, liver, and epithelial cells. Through pseudotime analysis, we construct the developmental trajectories of these progenitor cells and reveal the gene expression dynamics in the process of cell differentiation. We further reprogram primed H9 cells into naïve-like H9 cells to study the cellular-state transition process. We find that genes related to hemogenic endothelium development are enriched in naïve-like H9. Functionally, naïve-like H9 show higher potency for differentiation into hematopoietic lineages than primed cells. Our single-cell analysis reveals the cellular-state landscape of hPSC early differentiation, offering new insights that can be harnessed for optimization of differentiation protocols.","tags":["Single Cell","Single-cell RNA-seq","Primed human pluripotent stem cell","Embryoid body","Naïve human pluripotent stem cell"],"title":"Mapping human pluripotent stem cell differentiation pathways using high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qin Tang","Sowmya Iyer","Riadh Lobbardi","John C.

In this study, we used massively parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing to define cell heterogeneity within the zebrafish kidney marrow, constructing a comprehensive molecular atlas of definitive hematopoiesis and functionally distinct renal cells found in adult zebrafish. Because our method analyzed blood and kidney cells in an unbiased manner, our approach was useful in characterizing immune-cell deficiencies within DNA–protein kinase catalytic subunit (prkdc), interleukin-2 receptor γ a (il2rga), and double-homozygous–mutant fish, identifying blood cell losses in T, B, and natural killer cells within specific genetic mutants. Our analysis also uncovered novel cell types, including two classes of natural killer immune cells, classically defined and erythroid-primed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, mucin-secreting kidney cells, and kidney stem/progenitor cells. In total, our work provides the first, comprehensive, single-cell, transcriptomic analysis of kidney and marrow cells in the adult zebrafish.","tags":[],"title":"Dissecting hematopoietic and renal cell heterogeneity in adult zebrafish at single-cell resolution using RNA sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lan Jiang","Huidong Chen","Luca Pinello and Guo-Cheng Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"c9681b7a47d87c2d7c84b6723bc52e5d","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/publication/jiang-l-genome-biology-2016/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-l-genome-biology-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"High-throughput single-cell technologies have great potential to discover new cell types; however, it remains challenging to detect rare cell types that are distinct from a large population.

Application of GiniClust to public single-cell RNA-seq datasets uncovers previously unrecognized rare cell types, including Zscan4-expressing cells within mouse embryonic stem cells and hemoglobin-expressing cells in the mouse cortex and hippocampus.

Nucleosome positioning plays an important role in gene transcription regulation, DNA replication and repair, alternative splicing, and so on. With the rapid development of ChIP-seq, it is possible to computationally detect the positions of nucleosomes on chromosomes. However, existing methods cannot provide accurate and detailed information about the detected nucleosomes, especially for the nucleosomes with complex configurations where overlaps and noise exist. Meanwhile, they usually require some prior knowledge of nucleosomes as input, such as the size or the number of the unknown nucleosomes, which may significantly influence the detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DPNuc for identifying nucleosome positions based on the Dirichlet process mixture model. In our method, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are employed to determine the mixture model with no need of prior knowledge about nucleosomes. Compared with three existing methods, our approach can provide more detailed information of the detected nucleosomes and can more reasonably reveal the real configurations of the chromosomes; especially, our approach performs better in the complex overlapping situations. By mapping the detected nucleosomes to a synthetic benchmark nucleosome map and two existing benchmark nucleosome maps, it is shown that our approach achieves a better performance in identifying nucleosome positions and gets a higher F -score. Finally, we show that our approach can more reliably detect the size distribution of nucleosomes.","tags":[],"title":"DPNuc: Identifying Nucleosome Positions Based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model","type":"publication"}]
