With the lack of a comprehensive understanding of CAFs' functional distinctions, it remains unclear how cancer treatments could be personalized based on CAFs in a patient's tumor. We have established a living biobank of CAFs derived from biopsies of patients' non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) that encompasses a broad molecular spectrum of CAFs in clinical NSCLC. By functionally interrogating CAF heterogeneity using the same therapeutics received by patients, we identify three functional subtypes (1) robustly protective of cancers and highly expressing HGF and FGF7; (2) moderately protective of cancers and highly expressing FGF7; and (3) those providing minimal protection. These functional differences among CAFs are governed by their intrinsic TGF-β signaling, which suppresses HGF and FGF7 expression. This CAF functional classification correlates with patients' clinical response to targeted therapies and also associates with the tumor immune microenvironment, therefore providing an avenue to guide personalized treatment.","tags":["Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts","Tumor Heterogeneity","Lung Cancer","Patient-derived Models","Cancer Therapy","Personalized Medicine"],"title":"Three subtypes of lung cancer fibroblasts define distinct therapeutic paradigms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635638400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635638400,"objectID":"19577dd70ef12659a7785a429a619093","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/software/singlecellvr/","publishdate":"2021-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/singlecellvr/","section":"software","summary":"A user-friendly web application for visualizing single-cell data, designed for cheap and easily available virtual reality hardware http://www.singlecellvr.com.","tags":["Python","Dash","JavaScript"],"title":"singlecellVR","type":"software"},{"authors":["David F.

As these assays have advanced in their ability to measure various aspects of molecular processes in cells, computational methods to analyze and meaningfully visualize such data have required matched innovation. Independently, Virtual Reality (VR) has recently emerged as a powerful technology to dynamically explore complex data and shows promise for adaptation to challenges in single-cell data visualization. However, adopting VR for single-cell data visualization has thus far been hindered by expensive prerequisite hardware or advanced data preprocessing skills. To address current shortcomings, we present singlecellVR, a user-friendly web application for visualizing single-cell data, designed for cheap and easily available virtual reality hardware (e.g., Google Cardboard, ∼$8). singlecellVR can visualize data from a variety of sequencing-based technologies including transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data as well as combinations thereof. Analysis modalities supported include approaches to clustering as well as trajectory inference and visualization of dynamical changes discovered through modelling RNA velocity. We provide a companion software package, scvr to streamline data conversion from the most widely-adopted single-cell analysis tools as well as a growing database of pre-analyzed datasets to which users can contribute.","tags":["Single-cell","scRNA-seq","scATAC-seq","virtual reality","VR","Data Visualization","Clustering","Trajectory Inference","Velocity"],"title":"singlecellVR: Interactive Visualization of Single-Cell Data in Virtual Reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lingfei Wang","Qian Zhang","Qian Qin","Nikolaos Trasanidis","Michael Vinyard","Huidong Chen","Luca Pinello"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Here, we leverage high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a detailed transcriptomic atlas of young and aged murine mammary tissues. By analyzing epithelial, stromal, and immune cells, we identify age-dependent alterations in cell proportions and gene expression, providing evidence that suggests alveolar maturation and physiological decline. The analysis also uncovers potential pro-tumorigenic mechanisms coupled to the age-associated loss of tumor suppressor function and change in microenvironment. In addition, we identify a rare, age-dependent luminal population co-expressing hormone-sensing and secretory-alveolar lineage markers, as well as two macrophage populations expressing distinct gene signatures, underscoring the complex heterogeneity of the mammary epithelia and stroma. Collectively, this rich single-cell atlas reveals the effects of aging on mammary physiology and can serve as a useful resource for understanding aging-associated cancer risk.","tags":["Single-cell","scRNA-seq","Aging","Mammary Epithelia And Stroma","Luminal And Myoepithelial Cells","Trajectory Inference"],"title":"Aging-associated alterations in mammary epithelia and stroma revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huidong Chen","吳恩達"],"categories":null,"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Here, we combine single-cell transcriptomics and genetic recording to characterize EB differentiation. We map transcriptional states along a time course and model cell fate trajectories and branchpoints as cells progress to distinct germ layers. To validate this inferential model, we propose an innovative inducible genetic recording technique that leverages recombination to generate cell-specific, timestamp barcodes in a narrow temporal window. We validate trajectory architecture and key branchpoints, including early specification of a primordial germ cell (PGC)-like lineage from preimplantation epiblast-like cells. We further identify a temporally defined role of DNA methylation in this PGC-epiblast decision. Our study provides a high-resolution lineage map for an organoid model of embryogenesis, insights into epigenetic determinants of fate specification, and a strategy for lineage mapping of rapid differentiation processes.","tags":["Single-cell","scRNA-seq","Embryogenesis","Lineage Tracing","Stem Cells","Trajectory Inference"],"title":"Parallel single-cell RNA-seq and genetic recording reveals lineage decisions in developing embryoid bodies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Albergante","Evgeny Mirkes","Jonathan Bac","Huidong Chen","Alexis Martin","Louis Faure","Emmanuel Barillot","Luca Pinello","Alexander Gorban","Andrei Zinovyev"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Principal graphs approximate the multivariate data by a graph injected into the data space with some constraints imposed on the node mapping. Here we present ElPiGraph, a scalable and robust method for constructing principal graphs. ElPiGraph exploits and further develops the concept of elastic energy, the topological graph grammar approach, and a gradient descent-like optimization of the graph topology. The method is able to withstand high levels of noise and is capable of approximating data point clouds via principal graph ensembles. This strategy can be used to estimate the statistical significance of complex data features and to summarize them into a single consensus principal graph. ElPiGraph deals efficiently with large datasets in various fields such as biology, where it can be used for example with single-cell transcriptomic or epigenomic datasets to infer gene expression dynamics and recover differentiation landscapes.","tags":["Principal Graph","Data Approximation","Principal Trees","Topological Grammars"],"title":"Robust and scalable learning of complex intrinsic dataset geometry via ElPiGraph","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576022400,"objectID":"cbd4da710647151dca9bb6779949262e","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/software/stream_atac/","publishdate":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/stream_atac/","section":"software","summary":"A STREAM companion package for single cell ATAC-seq preprocessing","tags":["Python","R"],"title":"STREAM ATACseq","type":"software"},{"authors":["Huidong Chen","Caleb Lareau","Tommaso Andreani","Michael E.

However, a comprehensive single-cell level differentiation roadmap for hPSCs has not been achieved. We use high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), based on optimized microfluidic circuits, to profile early differentiation lineages in the human embryoid body system. We present a cellular-state landscape for hPSC early differentiation that covers multiple cellular lineages, including neural, muscle, endothelial, stromal, liver, and epithelial cells. Through pseudotime analysis, we construct the developmental trajectories of these progenitor cells and reveal the gene expression dynamics in the process of cell differentiation. We further reprogram primed H9 cells into naïve-like H9 cells to study the cellular-state transition process. We find that genes related to hemogenic endothelium development are enriched in naïve-like H9. Functionally, naïve-like H9 show higher potency for differentiation into hematopoietic lineages than primed cells. Our single-cell analysis reveals the cellular-state landscape of hPSC early differentiation, offering new insights that can be harnessed for optimization of differentiation protocols.","tags":["Single-cell","scRNA-seq","Human Pluripotent Stem Cell","Embryoid Body"],"title":"Mapping human pluripotent stem cell differentiation pathways using high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qin Tang","Sowmya Iyer","Riadh Lobbardi","John C.

In this study, we used massively parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing to define cell heterogeneity within the zebrafish kidney marrow, constructing a comprehensive molecular atlas of definitive hematopoiesis and functionally distinct renal cells found in adult zebrafish. Because our method analyzed blood and kidney cells in an unbiased manner, our approach was useful in characterizing immune-cell deficiencies within DNA–protein kinase catalytic subunit (prkdc), interleukin-2 receptor γ a (il2rga), and double-homozygous–mutant fish, identifying blood cell losses in T, B, and natural killer cells within specific genetic mutants. Our analysis also uncovered novel cell types, including two classes of natural killer immune cells, classically defined and erythroid-primed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, mucin-secreting kidney cells, and kidney stem/progenitor cells. In total, our work provides the first, comprehensive, single-cell, transcriptomic analysis of kidney and marrow cells in the adult zebrafish.","tags":["Single-cell","scRNA-seq","Zebrafish","Cell Heterogeneity","Clustering","Pseudotime","Trajectory Inference","Hematopoiesis"],"title":"Dissecting hematopoietic and renal cell heterogeneity in adult zebrafish at single-cell resolution using RNA sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lan Jiang","Huidong Chen","Luca Pinello","Guo-Cheng Yuan"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

We present a novel computational method, called GiniClust, to overcome this challenge. Validation against a benchmark dataset indicates that GiniClust achieves high sensitivity and specificity. Application of GiniClust to public single-cell RNA-seq datasets uncovers previously unrecognized rare cell types, including Zscan4-expressing cells within mouse embryonic stem cells and hemoglobin-expressing cells in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. GiniClust also correctly detects a small number of normal cells that are mixed in a cancer cell population.","tags":["Single-cell","scRNA-seq","Rare Cells","Gini Index","Clustering"],"title":"GiniClust: detecting rare cell types from single-cell gene expression data with Gini index","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huidong Chen","Jihong Guan","Shuigeng Zhou"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Nucleosome positioning plays an important role in gene transcription regulation, DNA replication and repair, alternative splicing, and so on. With the rapid development of ChIP-seq, it is possible to computationally detect the positions of nucleosomes on chromosomes. However, existing methods cannot provide accurate and detailed information about the detected nucleosomes, especially for the nucleosomes with complex configurations where overlaps and noise exist. Meanwhile, they usually require some prior knowledge of nucleosomes as input, such as the size or the number of the unknown nucleosomes, which may significantly influence the detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DPNuc for identifying nucleosome positions based on the Dirichlet process mixture model. In our method, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are employed to determine the mixture model with no need of prior knowledge about nucleosomes. Compared with three existing methods, our approach can provide more detailed information of the detected nucleosomes and can more reasonably reveal the real configurations of the chromosomes; especially, our approach performs better in the complex overlapping situations. By mapping the detected nucleosomes to a synthetic benchmark nucleosome map and two existing benchmark nucleosome maps, it is shown that our approach achieves a better performance in identifying nucleosome positions and gets a higher F-score. Finally, we show that our approach can more reliably detect the size distribution of nucleosomes.","tags":["Nucleosome Positioning","Epigenome","Dirichlet Process","Markov Chain Monte Carlo","MNase-seq"],"title":"Single-cell trajectories reconstruction, exploration and mapping of omics data with STREAM","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"88b965a72a525aba735bfe95f6b08a9c","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/software/megatron/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/megatron/","section":"software","summary":"MEGA TRajectories of clONes.","tags":["Python"],"title":"MEGATRON (coming soon)","type":"software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c9ed2866cbf1e0f3e7c59366c14f68b3","permalink":"https://huidongchen.github.io/software/stream2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/stream2/","section":"software","summary":"Fast, scalable, and interactive trajectory analysis of single-cell omics data.","tags":["Python"],"title":"STREAM2 (coming soon)","type":"software"}]
